windows-checks-bats
===================

Batch files to do basic IT checks such as ping test, check log files etc

These scripts output a JSON Array but can easily be changed to output anything else. 

Why?
----

Needed to automate basic IT checks in an environment with different technologies and setups. Tried to make the scripts as flexible as possible. 

Installation
------------

	Just download the files in a folder on your windows PC

Output
------
Prints on the screen a **notation** and on the next line the **JSON Array** with the results. The notation is printed to help applications recognize when the JSON Array begins. 

Scripts
-------

### pingTest.bat

Performs ping on the IPs given and returns a JSON array 

**Usage**

	pingTest.bat target1 target2

**Output**

	<notation>[{"name":"DISPLAYNAME", "value":"YES/NO"}]
